# LASP Interview Question

Running `./main.sh` will print the json string, with no formatting, to the console. To validate (and add formatting) you can use [jsonlint](https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint) by running `./main.sh | jsonlint`. If you'd like to see xml output, run `./xml.sh`.
I implemented the function to find the `true_val` and to replace the values for `Courage` and `Stupidity` in both the json and xml files. You can see how I did this by checking out the `find_true_val` in `main.py`.
